# The Algorithm Challenge

Let's practice the algorithms and data-structures using only Typescript, VIM and TDD (The exercises are from FreeCodeCamp)

## Process

I copy and paste the instructions from FreeCodeCamp, then I write the tests and finally I try to resolve the problem.

## Installation

This project needs `node` and `npm`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Junscuzzy/the-algorithm-challenge
cd the-algorithm-challenge
npm i
npm run start // run tests with --watch
```

## Summary
